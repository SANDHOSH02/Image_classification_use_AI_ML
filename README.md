# Image Classification using AI/ML to Predict Sensitive and Non-Sensitive Data

This project focuses on detecting sensitive content in images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow and Keras. The primary goal is to classify images as either *sensitive* or *non-sensitive* by training the model on sample datasets.

## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to classify images into sensitive or non-sensitive categories. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to make predictions after being trained on a dataset containing labeled sensitive and non-sensitive images.

## Features

- Detects sensitive and non-sensitive content in images.
- Uses CNN for high accuracy in image classification.
- Can be trained and fine-tuned with custom datasets.
- Easy-to-use interface for model training and prediction.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language.
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework for model development.
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API for building and training the CNN.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing (optional).
- **NumPy**: To handle array operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data and results.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of sample images categorized into two classes:

1. **Sensitive**: Images containing private or sensitive content.
2. **Non-Sensitive**: General images without sensitive information.

You can use any dataset that fits these categories. The dataset should be organized in the following directory structure:


## Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of a CNN built using Keras with layers such as:

- Convolutional Layers
- Max Pooling Layers
- Fully Connected Layers
- Dropout for regularization

The final layer outputs a binary classification for sensitive and non-sensitive images.
